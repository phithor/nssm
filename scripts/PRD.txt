Nordic Stock Sentiment Monitor (NSSM)
Draft Version
Owner: [Your Name]

Overview
NSSM is a personal research assistant that gives you real-time monitoring of Nordic investor forums and correlates them with market data and official news.

Problem: Scandinavian retail forums like Hegnar Online and Avanza Forum generate alpha-moving chatter, but following them manually is inefficient and nearly impossible at scale.

Solution: Automate collection → sentiment analysis → alerting so that you can spot unusual “buzz” and emerging momentum in specific stocks before markets or media react.

Scope:

Initially a personal-use tool running locally or in a private cloud (not yet SaaS).

Later optionally productized and sold to other traders/researchers.

Core Features
1. Forum Scraping & Data Collection
What it does: Monitors selected forums (Hegnar, Avanza) continuously, scrapes posts, stores raw data.

Why important (your use): You get the full firehose of chatter, with a private archive.

How it works: Heuristic scrapers with cron scheduling; parsed & ingested into a local database.

2. Sentiment & Momentum Analyzer
What it does: Classifies forum chatter sentiment and detects unusual growth in post counts.

Why important: Captures early market hype; lets you prioritize which tickers to investigate.

How it works: ML models fine-tuned on Scandinavian text → aggregated sentiment per stock per time interval → anomaly detection (rolling averages & volatility thresholds).

3. Alerts (Optional for you)
What it does: Flag and notify when a stock starts buzzing or sentiment flips.

Why important: Minimize the need to stare at the dashboard, highlighting actionable moments.

How it works: Local notifications/terminal logs/desktop push. Could also trigger webhook to phone.

4. Market Data & News Integration
What it does: Adds “real” context from OpenBB SDK, Yahoo Finance, or RSS feeds (Oslo Børs, OMX).

Why important: Lets you distinguish between retail-driven chatter vs real company news.

How it works: Simple background pull of market data into same DB, aligned by ticker+timestamp.

5. Personal Dashboard
What it does: Provides you with dynamic plots and lists.

Why important: You don’t need to sift raw logs — just see which stocks are moving.

How it works: Local web dashboard with heatmaps (buzz level), sentiment charts, timelines.

User Experience
Since this is for you first, UX can be lightweight but still intuitive.

User Persona (Primary)
You: Quant/retail trader monitoring Nordic equities; wants an “extra set of eyes.”

User Flow
Start backend → Scraper ingests forum chatter automatically.

Open dashboard → See “Top Buzzing Nordic Stocks.”

Drill into ticker → View sentiment curve + matching stock moves + official news.

(Optional) Setup alert config file → receive ping when criteria met.

UX Considerations
Minimal polish needed initially — HTML dashboards / Streamlit / Dash can suffice.

Focus more on data visibility and fast signal, not enterprise-grade UI yet.

Technical Architecture
System Components
Scrapers: Custom-built (probably Python requests+bs4, Selenium if needed).

Processor: NLP pipeline (HuggingFace Scandinavian models), mention extraction, time-series aggregator.

Data Storage: PostgreSQL for structured; simple disk/S3-like folder for raw logs.

Analysis: Python stack (pandas, scikit-learn, Prophet/ARIMA for momentum detection).

UI: Lightweight Streamlit or Dash app → interactive data + plots.

Data Models
Posts: {forum, stock ticker(s), timestamp, sentiment score, raw text}.

Stocks: {ticker, exchange, sector, linked posts, time-series sentiment values}.

Alerts: {condition, triggered_time}.

Integrations
Finance data: OpenBB SDK plug-in modules.

News feeds: RSS/Oslo Børs/Nasdaq OMX scrapers.

Optional future: Telegram/Discord/Slack push bots.

Infrastructure
Local machine, home NAS, or cheap cloud VM (Hetzner, DO, AWS Lightsail).

Docker for portability.

Cron jobs + supervisor for scrapers.

Development Roadmap
MVP (Usable for Personal Use)
Scraper: Hegnar + Avanza basic ingestion.

NLP pipeline: classify posts as pos/neg.

DB: PostgreSQL with post storage + ticker mapping.

Dashboard: Top Buzzing Stocks + timeline of sentiment.

Next Iteration
Add anomaly detection (buzz spikes).

Basic alerting (local notification/logs).

Overlay OpenBB market data.

Later Enhancements
Add additional forums + Twitter/X hashtags.

Fancier NLP (neutral class, sarcasm handling).

More sophisticated anomaly detection (rolling z-score).

Personal forecasting/exploration module (backtest chatter vs price).

Logical Dependency Chain
Build data collection layer (without this, nothing else works).

Add basic database + ticker classification.

Implement simple dashboard (get a usable artifact early).

Plug in basic NLP sentiment scoring.

Build anomaly detection and alerting hooks.

Expand scope: news/market data + advanced NLP.

Risks and Mitigations
Forum Blocking: Aggressive scraping might get blocked.

Mitigation: Rotate IPs/user-agents; schedule polite scraping; randomize request times.

NLP Noise: High misclassification due to colloquial slang/sarcasm.

Mitigation: Build custom keyword lexicon for finance slang (e.g., "rakett", "dobler", “emisjon”).

Time Investment: Can get bogged down in infrastructure.

Mitigation: For personal MVP, keep stack simple (Streamlit over fancy microservices). Only optimize later.

Data Overload: Even small forums output tons of posts daily.

Mitigation: Focus only on ticker mentions, avoid deep storage of irrelevant posts (off-topic chatter).

Appendix
Research Findings
Hegnar Forum: High activity on small-cap Norwegian equities; often “pump and hype.”

Avanza Forum: Large Swedish community; more structured but hype cycles emerge too.

Stock Influencers: Twitter/X still relevant, but forums are narrower, less “noise.”

Edge: Retail sentiment can precede news releases by hours/days in illiquid Nordic stocks.

Technical Notes
HuggingFace models: NbBERT, SweBERT.

Visual libraries: Plotly/Dash, Streamlit for quick prototyping.

Storage: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB extension for time-series queries.

✅ **This updated PRD assumes it’s for your private use first:

Easier infrastructure (no SaaS constraints).

No GDPR/user privacy overhead.

Scraping is designed-in, regardless of “asks not to scrape.”

Still modular enough to later add multi-user, SaaS-style scaling if you choose to commercialize.
